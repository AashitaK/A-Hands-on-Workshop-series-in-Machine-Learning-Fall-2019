    "There are multiple algorithms to build the decision trees, but we will discuss the most commonly used one - CART (Classification And Regression Trees). The algorithm will decide how to split the nodes at each level starting from the top (root).\n",

    "* Root\n",
    "* Split nodes\n",
    "* Branches: usually two, but can be more.\n",

    "\n",
    "The paths from the root to the leaf nodes represents the classification rules. Each example will fall in exactly one of the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the leaf nodes be denoted by $R_m$ for $m = 1 \\dots M$, then the identity function $I_{R_m}$ will be 1 if and only if the example belongs to it, otherwise zero.\n",

    "If an example, say $x$, falls in $R_k$, then $\\hat{y} = c_k$ where $c_k$ is the average of the outputs for all training examples in $R_k$. Clearly, we want $c_k$ to be close to the true output for the example $x$ and also for all the examples falling in that leaf node. This can be achieved if our tree is built such that the outputs for all examples in a node are close to each other. \n",

    "This can be rephrased as: For a good decision tree, each leaf node must consists of the examples belonging to the same class as much as possible.\n",
