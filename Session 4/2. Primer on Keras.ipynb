    "#### Instructor: Aashita Kesarwani\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know a bit about neural networks and how they work, we want to know how to implement them. We will use Keras python library with TensorFlow backend. Keras provides a user-friendly interface to use TensorFlow and build the models quickly. Both Keras and TensorFlow are robust and powerful python libraries commonly used for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to build models in Keras, sequential and functional. \n",
    "* The sequential API allows us to create layer-by-layer models with multiple inputs and outputs, but is limited in its flexibility. \n",
    "* The functional API allows us to create models where we can connect any layer to any other layer, rather than only the layers immediately adjacent to it. It is useful for more advanced architectures where sequential API no longer suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this primer we will be focusing on the sequential API for ease and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). Let us first import the data into a pandas dataframe `df`."
