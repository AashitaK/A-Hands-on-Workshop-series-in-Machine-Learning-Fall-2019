## A Hands-on Workshop series in Machine Learning 
Time: **5:45-7:45 pm** on 7 consecutive **Wednesdays** starting **Oct 02 to Nov 13, 2019**   
Venue: **Aviation Room, Hoch-Shanahan Dining Commons, HMC**   

The seats are already claimed for the workshop, including the waitlist. We are accepting [registration](https://forms.gle/3VdVMqV1EctC7aiE6) for waitlist for later sessions, in case the participants drop out. The workshop material will be made available here along with the lecture capture after each session. 


The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning using real-world datasets and the tools in the Python ecosystem. It is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python but is also designed adaptively so that you will be challenged even if you have some familiarity with machine learning tools. 

You will learn the minimal but most useful tools for exploring datasets using pandas quickly and then move on to the conventional machine learning algorithms and other related concepts that comes in handy for all models including neural networks. The neural networks will be introduced gently from the fourth session onwards and you will learn some more involved architectures such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and apply them to real-world datasets. The sessions will be a good mix of theory explained intuitively in a simplified manner and hands-on exercises.


Each session of the workshop will build on the previous ones. It is important that you attend all the sessions of the series for it to be useful. The learning material will be made available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning) a few minutes before each session. The solutions to the hands-on exercises will be uploaded in [the same repository](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning) after each session.

#### Pre-requisites:
1. The workshop will cover the data science and deep learning tools in the Python ecosystem from the scratch. Some familiarity with Python is a pre-requisite. If you have a grip on the basics of coding in some other language such as Javascript, that should suffice too. 
2. Basics of probability and statistics
3. Basics of Calculus
4. Basics of Linear Algebra

#### What to bring:  
Please bring your laptop fully charged and with WiFi connection. Please [download and install Anaconda with Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) in your laptop ahead of the workshop.  

### Topics to be covered:  
#### Sessions 1-3: 
* Data manipulation using `pandas`
* Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
* Traditional machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) using `scikit-learn`
* Underfitting and Overfitting to the training dataset, Cross-validation and k-fold Cross-validation
* Imbalanced datasets 
* Classification metrices - Confusion matrix, Decision Threshold, Precision/Recall, F1-score, Area Under ROC curve, etc.
* Application of the above tools and concepts to build a prediction model using Election Dataset by [ANES](https://electionstudies.org/)
* Publishing independent projects and sharing work using Github Pages and Kaggle

#### Session 4: 
* Building the intuition of the training process of neural networks using the cost function and gradient descent algorithm in linear and logistic regression.
* Multi-Layer Perception: Forward and Backward propagation
* A primer on `Keras`

* Tuning other hyper-parameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, etc.
* Batch normalization
* Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA
* Application of the above concepts on Bike Sharing Dataset

#### Session 6: 
* Image preprocessing
* Convolution Neural Networks architecture (CNN)
* Training a CNN model on MNIST dataset

#### Session 7:
* A brief overview of neural network frameworks/architectures used in Computer Vision
* Transfer Learning
* Autoencoders
* An overview of computing and dataset resources
* Using Anaconda as a package management and environment management tool
* A small project
* Open questions

***The topics may be shuffled around and added/eliminated without notice, in view of time-constraint for the two hour sessions, as the learning material is being build on.***
