### A Hands-on Workshop series in Machine Learning 
Time: **05:45-7:45 pm** for 7 consecutive **Wednesdays** starting **Oct 02 to Nov 13, 2019**   
Venue: **Aviation Room, Hoch-Shanahan Dining Commons, HMC** 

The workshop is open to everyone from The Claremont Colleges on a first-come first-serve basis. Please [register here](https://forms.gle/3VdVMqV1EctC7aiE6).

Machine learning algorithms will be introduced with a “learn-by-doing” approach using python tools such as pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, etc. on real-world datasets.

### Topics covered:  
#### Sessions 1-3: 
* Data manipulation using `pandas`
* Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
* Traditional machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) using scikit-learn
* Overfitting to the training set, cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation
* Imbalanced datasets 
* Classification metrices - Confusion matrix, Decision Threshold, Precision/Recall, F1-score, Area Under ROC curve, etc.
* Application of the above tools and concepts to build a prediction model using Election Dataset by ANES.

#### Session 4: 
* Introducing the intuition of neural networks starting from linear and logistic regression using cost function and gradient descent
* Multi-layer perception: Forward and Backward propogation
* A primer on `Keras`
* Training a neural network on Election Dataset

#### Session 5:
* Vanishing gradient problem
* Various activation functions and when to use them
* Regularization
* Dropout
* Tuning other hyper-parameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, etc.
* Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA
* Application of the above concepts on Bike Sharing Dataset

#### Session 6: 
* Image preprocessing
* Convolution Neural Networks architecture (CNN)
* Training a CNN model on MNIST dataset

#### Session 7:
* A brief overview of Advanced Neural Network architectures used in Computer Vision
* Autoencoders
* An overview of computing and dataset resources
* A small project
* Open questions

***The topics may be shuffled around and added/eliminated without notice, in view of time-constraint for the two hour sessions, as the learning material is build on.***

The learning material will be made available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning) a few minutes before each session.

This page will be frequently updated with more information.
